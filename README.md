Welcome to my personal engineering journal. This repository contains my technical blog where I document architectural decisions, deep dives into the MERN stack, and the journey of building impact-driven software like **Emergency QR**.

## Purpose
As an SDE, I believe that writing is just as important as coding. This blog serves as a "Proof of Work" for my technical thinking process, covering topics like:
- **Full-Stack Architecture:** Scaling MERN applications for millions of users.
- **Security & Reliability:** Implementing JWT, Bcrypt, and data sanitization.
- **Real-World Problem Solving:** Deploying production-ready code and handling CORS/Environment hurdles.
- **DSA:** Exploring Python-based algorithmic optimizations.

## Key Features
- **Clean SDE Aesthetic:** Minimalist, performance-focused design.
- **Dark Mode Support:** Native system-preference detection with a manual toggle.
- **Syntax Highlighting:** Integrated with **Prism.js** for readable code snippets.
- **Responsive Navigation:** Custom-built mobile hamburger menu with zero dependencies.
- **SEO Optimized:** Semantic HTML5 structure for better indexing.

## Tech Stack
This project is intentionally built using **Pure Vanilla Web Technologies** to demonstrate a mastery of the core fundamentals:
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Variables/Grid/Flexbox).
- **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
- **Tooling:** [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) for technical code rendering.
